# sql-workshop

This is material for [Hashrocket][hr]'s SQL workshop at [Code Platoon][cp].

At Hashrocket, we ðŸ’œ SQL! This engagement has given us many opportunities to
share that passion, in a practical and hands-on way, with the veterans and
spouses of Code Platoon.

Check out the [Agenda][agenda] to see how the day will progress.

### Setup

Prerequisites: [PostgreSQL][pg]. If you can enter psql, we're in business:

```
$ psql
psql (11.1, server 11.6)
you=#
```

This is really important; please try to have a working PostgreSQL REPL ready
before we begin!

We'll start with the Phone Book domain.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jwworth/sql-workshop
$ cd sql-workshop/phone_book
```

Open up the `lesson.sql` you find there in your text editor.
